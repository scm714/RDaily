## Creation of the Day 2 Script
# 
# Assignment:
# In short, make a new file that will be included 
# in the GitHub repo online AND in your local git repo 
# (on your computer).  Once you have created the file, 
# merge it to your local git and the github repo by 
# committing the changes.  There are a ton of points 
# and clicks that follow BUT you can also do it by code 
# using the `usethis()` function.  
# 
# You do it and then paste your code below.
# 
# <SCM, insert your code here>

## New file to insert has been created!
